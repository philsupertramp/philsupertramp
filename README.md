### Hi there 👋
My name is Philipp.
I'm a pregrad math student and software engineering entusiast that loves to explore numerical and statistical methods to solve problems.

- 🔭 I’m currently working on [philsupertramp/game-math](https://github.com/philsupertramp/game-math) a math library for game developers, which includes a load of mathematical helpers to do all sorts of things
- 🌱 I’m currently learning techniques of Game Development 👾, Machine Learning 🤖, Reinforced Deep-Q-Learning 🐤 and solving differential equations 📈.
