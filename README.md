### Hi there 👋
My name is Philipp.
I have a B. Sc. in Mathematics and am a big software engineering entusiast that loves to explore numerical and statistical methods to solve problems.

- 👨‍🏫 Early 2022 I wrote my Thesis with the topic: **"Machine Learning Methods for Localiazation and Classification of Insects in Images"** and plan to build a more advanced guideline for object detection / image classification tasks.
- 🤖 I recently released [philsupertramp/chain-smoker](https://github.com/philsupertramp/chain-smoker) a testing tool to record and execute (mainly REST-API) smoke tests.
- 🔭 I’m currently working on [philsupertramp/game-math](https://github.com/philsupertramp/game-math) a math library for game developers, which includes a load of mathematical helpers to do all sorts of things
- 🌱 I’m currently learning techniques of Game Development 👾, Machine Learning 🤖, Computer Vision 🌎, Reinforced Deep-Q-Learning 🐤 and solving differential equations 📈.
