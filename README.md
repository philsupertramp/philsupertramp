### Hi there 👋
My name is Philipp.
I have a B. Sc. in Mathematics and am a big software engineering entusiast that loves to explore numerical and statistical methods to solve problems.

My most recent projects are
- [philipp-zettl/factory](https://github.com/philipp-zettl/factory): a generative AI service that bundles wide-spread Text-To-Image, Text-To-Text, Text-To-Speech and Speech-Recognition tasks. It's constantly getting updates and it's for sure worth a look!
- [philsupertramp/diffuse](https://GitHub.com/philsupertramp/diffuse) W.I.P. c++ implementation of stable diffusion to enable blazing fast inference on non-cuda devices. We start off with a CUDA and bare c++ implementation, to support NVIDIA GPU and any CPU, then implement ROCm and OpenCL alternatives. For now we don't plan to support mlx (metal/Apple Inc.).

Until 2021 my main focus in software development was to build useful tools for WebDev and everything involved in it.  
Ranging from an educational course in
- 🐋 [philsupertramp/docker](https://github.com/philsupertramp/docker) a "3 day" course on how to use docker

To usability tools like a helper/wrapper script around docker-compose
- 🐋 [philsupertramp/docr](https://github.com/philsupertramp/docr) a docker-compose utility script

An API testing framework
- 🤖 [philsupertramp/chain-smoker](https://github.com/philsupertramp/chain-smoker) a testing tool to record and execute (mainly REST-API) smoke tests.

And many many extensions for Django (a python web framework)
- 🐮 [Django](https://www.djangoproject.com/) tools: [philsupertramp/django-data-migration](https://github.com/philsupertramp/django-data-migration) a decoupled migration system exclusively for data transformations and [philsupertramp/dj-migration-test](https://github.com/philsupertramp/dj-migration-test) a django library assisting to write unit tests for data migrations.

Apart from this, I've also published my starter repository for TeX Projects
- 🗎 [philsupertramp/tex-starter](https://github.com/philsupertramp/tex-starter) a LaTeX starter project, to jump-start a large tex document

and I am the proud author of

- 🔭 [philsupertramp/game-math](https://github.com/philsupertramp/game-math) a math library for game developers, which includes a load of mathematical helpers to do all sorts of things, including several Machine Learning algorithms too and the beginning of a symbolic math extension.
  
  
There is much more to discover in my repositories, give em a look you won't regret it 😉

- 👨‍🏫 Early 2022 I wrote [my Thesis](https://github.com/philsupertramp/inet) with the topic: **"Machine Learning Methods for Localiazation and Classification of Insects in Images"** and plan to build a more advanced guideline for object detection / image classification tasks.
- 🧑‍🏫 In summer 2023 I taught an introductory class to Machine Learning at Berliner Hochschule für Technik (BHT)
