    description:
      - "Founding engineer for MoBerries automation platform spin-off. Solo Python engineer 
responsible for backend services, ML integrations, and AWS infrastructure (EKS). 
Evolved prototype codebase into production system through systematic refactoring, 
establishing $\\approx 98\\%$ test coverage, CI/CD pipelines, and engineering best practices 
(RFC workflow, semantic versioning, release processes). Reduced deployment cycles 
from hours to minutes."

      - "Built modular automation framework with reusable building blocks for AI-powered 
workflows. Implemented semantic search (Qdrant), document text extraction, multi-class 
text classification, and image generation using self-hosted models (llama.cpp) with 
cloud provider fallbacks. Extended platform capabilities through new automation 
modules as product requirements evolved."

      - "Managed AWS EKS infrastructure with auto-scaling, monitoring, and self-hosted LLM 
deployments. Collaborated with CTO and offshore developer to bring platform from 
prototype to market-ready state within 12 months."

    description:
      - "Owned all Python engineering and led 2-person team. Architected distributed AI 
automation platform from scratch, replacing 3 duplicate messaging codebases with 
Django-based orchestration layer and stateless Python microservices for message 
parsing, routing, and AI task execution. Platform processed 2M+ messages 
latency across WhatsApp, Telegram, and Meta Messenger, handling 650+ concurrent 
AI generation requests. Platform success led to easybits GmbH spin-off in 2025."
      - "Evolved intent classification through systematic iteration: keyword-based → 
fine-tuned xlm-RoBERTa → fine-tuned Qwen2-1.5B → currently OpenAI o1-mini for big scale production data collection. 
Final in-house model achieved 99\\% accuracy (0.99 F1 score) on zero-shot 5-class 
classification. Integrated self-hosted LLMs with cloud provider fallbacks for 
production automation workflows."
      - "Mentored DevOps engineer and BI analyst, reviewing their work and supporting 
infrastructure automation and data pipeline development."

    company: "MoBerries GmbH"
    techstack: Python, Django, JavaScript, React, PostgreSQL, MongoDB, RabbitMQ, Docker, Kubernetes, Terraform, AWS
    description:
      - "Rapid progression from junior developer to technical lead over 3.5 years during 
company downsizing. Started in 3-person team maintaining internal backend; by 2020 
became sole Python backend engineer supporting 10+ developers across teams with 
features, fixes, and infrastructure improvements."

      - "Built and open-sourced \\href{https://gist.github.com/philsupertramp/4bb01105a07b055363ea1172768453cd}{Django migration tooling} (2019) to address codebase 
complexity: squashed 500-node migration graph to ~150 nodes through automated 
consolidation, then created \\href{https://github.com/philsupertramp/django-data-migration}{data migration framework} enabling data evolution 
without breaking migration dependencies. Tools became critical for maintaining 
production stability during team transitions."

      - "Established comprehensive test coverage in absence of QA team, implemented CI/CD 
improvements, and maintained production systems through multiple scaling phases. 
Led team of 2 developers (1 FT, 1 PT) starting 2021."

      - "Transitioned to ML/matching focus (late 2021), growing team to 3 full-time 
developers by 2022. Built Arabic language matching prototype for Middle East 
expansion and Google Sheets integration enabling sales team to score candidate-job 
pairs in real-time by auto-parsing spreadsheet data to internal matching API."
