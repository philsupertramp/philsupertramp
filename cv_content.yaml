    description:
      - Re-architected prototype services into production-grade microservices with $\approx 98\%$ unit test coverage, reducing deployment time from hpurs to minutes through CI/CD automation.
      - Designed and implemented new automation solutions using self hosted models as well as API providers, e.g. semantic-search, text extraction for documents, text classification and image generation solutions.
      - Created and maintained the platform infrastructure on AWS (EKS cluster), running auto scaling and monitoring services as well as self hosted LLMs and the platform services
      - Introduced platform security mechanics, e.g. RFC like workflow for core changes, semantic versioning, release processes.

    description:
      - "Owned all Python engineering and led 2-person team. Architected distributed AI 
automation platform from scratch, replacing 3 duplicate messaging codebases with 
Django-based orchestration layer and stateless Python microservices for message 
parsing, routing, and AI task execution. Platform processed 2M+ messages 
latency across WhatsApp, Telegram, and Meta Messenger, handling 650+ concurrent 
AI generation requests. Platform success led to easybits GmbH spin-off in 2025."
      - "Evolved intent classification through systematic iteration: keyword-based → 
fine-tuned xlm-RoBERTa → fine-tuned Qwen2-1.5B → currently OpenAI o1-mini for big scale production data collection. 
Final in-house model achieved 99% accuracy (0.99 F1 score) on zero-shot 5-class 
classification. Integrated self-hosted LLMs with cloud provider fallbacks for 
production automation workflows."
      - "Mentored DevOps engineer and BI analyst, reviewing their work and supporting 
infrastructure automation and data pipeline development."

    description:
      - "Rapid progression from junior developer to technical lead over 3.5 years during 
company downsizing. Started in 3-person team maintaining internal backend; by 2020 
became sole Python backend engineer supporting 10+ developers across teams with 
features, fixes, and infrastructure improvements."

      - "Built and open-sourced \\href{https://gist.github.com/philsupertramp/4bb01105a07b055363ea1172768453cd}{Django migration tooling} (2019) to address codebase 
complexity: squashed 500-node migration graph to ~150 nodes through automated 
consolidation, then created \\href{https://github.com/philsupertramp/django-data-migration}{data migration framework} enabling data evolution 
without breaking migration dependencies. Tools became critical for maintaining 
production stability during team transitions."

      - "Established comprehensive test coverage in absence of QA team, implemented CI/CD 
improvements, and maintained production systems through multiple scaling phases. 
Led team of 2 developers (1 FT, 1 PT) starting 2021."

      - "Transitioned to ML/matching focus (late 2021), growing team to 3 full-time 
developers by 2022. Built Arabic language matching prototype for Middle East 
expansion and Google Sheets integration enabling sales team to score candidate-job 
pairs in real-time by auto-parsing spreadsheet data to internal matching API."
