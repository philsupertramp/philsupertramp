% Usage: \cventry{Year--Year}{Job Title}{Employer}{City}{}{Description}

\cventry{Jan 2025--Present}{Solutions Architect \& Founding Engineer}{easybits GmbH (Spin-off from MoBerries)}{Berlin}{}{%
\begin{itemize}
  \item \textbf{Strategic Spin-off}: Leading technical R&D for the entity spun out of MoBerries, continuing the development of the automation platform originally architected in 2023.
  \item \textbf{Platform Engineering}: Transforming the prototype into a production-grade, asynchronous processing engine (Python/FastAPI) capable of handling high-concurrency message routing.
  \item \textbf{Client Implementation}: overseeing the integration of complex business logic into modular workflows, ensuring zero downtime during the transition from the parent company.
\end{itemize}}

\cventry{May 2022--Jan 2025}{Solutions Architect \& Lead Backend Engineer}{MoBerries GmbH}{Berlin}{}{%
Expanded product offerings by innovating core platform features and designing scalable backend architecture.
\begin{itemize}
  \item Extended and maintained the platform's core matching algorithms, enhancing the quality of candidate-to-job recommendations.
  \item \textbf{System Design:} Architected the core automation engine that successfully spun off into easybits GmbH, becoming the foundational technology for the new venture.
  \item \textbf{Architecture:} Designed the system using a modular structure and a custom lightweight CMS to enable rapid creation of AI/ML automations that can be used via APIs and Websockets.
  \item Defined communication protocols and schemes, implemented automation workflows ranging from generic wrappers for service provider APIs to tailored solutions, including fine-tuning ML models for specific routing and context extraction tasks.
\end{itemize}}

\cventry{2018--Apr 2022}{Python Backend Lead (Acting Head of ML)}{MoBerries GmbH}{Berlin}{}{%
Started as a Working Student focusing on maintenance and expansion of the core backend API and advanced to take full ownership of the company's overall Python codebase.
